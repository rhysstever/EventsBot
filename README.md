# EventsBot
A Slack bot, written in Python, that allows users to view events from a Google Calendar, using the Google Calendar API.

## Commands
* /events: Lists the very next event for that day

### Commands to be implemented
* /events today: Lists all events happening that day
* /events tomorrow: Lists all events happening tomorrow
* /events this week: Lists all events happening that week
* /events nect week: Lists all events happening the following week

## Why I Made This
I created this bot in order to contribute to house. Though I used it as a major project, I knew I wanted to challenge myself by learning something new. This project hits both, contributing to house, as well as challenging me to learn something new. Slack bots have always interested me, so I knew this is what I wanted to take on and do. 

## Benefit/Problem It Solves
This project benefits house by allowing memebers to view which events are upcoming, without leaving Slack. In the future, I also look to implement an add event function for eboard members (as they are the only ones that can add events to the calendar) to ease that process as well. 

## What I Learned
On top of learning the steps to make a **Slack bot**, I learned basic **Python**, as well as **Git Bash**- both of which I have never used before.This was also my first time using/interacting with an **API** of any kind. Thankfully, the Google Calendar API had easy documentation to follow. To implement the bot into Slack, I also learned how to setup and deploy on **OpenShift**.

## Hardest Part
The hardest part of this project was (is) connecting the API to Slack. I am currently still working on this and hope to finish it soon so the bot can be implemented into the Slack channel. This has proven to be the most difficult, since Slack times out and returns an error.
