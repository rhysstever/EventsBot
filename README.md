# RosterBot
A Slack bot that allows users (a leader of a team or group) to create rosters of other users. 
The leader can add events to a roster and the slack bot will notify all roster members.
When members respond, data will be sent back to the leader on who can come to the event and who cannot.

## Commands
* /create_roster : creates a new roster
* /addplayer : adds a player to the roster
* /addevent : adds an event to a roster
