# EventsBot
A Slack bot, written in Python, that allows users to view events from a Google Calendar,
through use of the Google Calendar API.

## Commands
* /events: Lists the very next event for that day

### Commands to be implemented
* /events today: Lists all events happening that day
* /events tomorrow: Lists all events happening tomorrow
* /events this week: Lists all events happening that week
* /events nect week: Lists all events happening the following week

## What I Learned
On top of learning the steps to make a **Slack bot**, I learned basic **Python**, as well as **Git Bash**- both of which 
I have never used before.This was also my first time using/interacting with an **API** of any kind. Thankfully, the 
Google Calendar API had easy documentation to follow. To implement the bot into Slack, I also learned how to setup and deploy 
on **OpenShift**.

## Hardest Part
The hardest part of this project was (is) connecting the API to Slack. I am currently still working on this and hope to 
finish it soon so the bot can be implemented into the Slack channel. This has proven to be the most difficult, since Slack 
times out and returns an error.
